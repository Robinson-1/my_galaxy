# Introduction

This is from freecodecamp [code follow allong/tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8Imtec4ReQ) to learn Kivy.
Audio/fonts/imges are available [here](https://codewithjonathan.net/resourceskivy). 

## Extentions

### Incremental speed

Speed is now incremented with time. Added at a rate of `self.speed += dt/10` after some experimentation.

### Added a screen manager

Added screen management. This will eventually be updated to include settings screen and potentially other game modes.

### Added a highscores button on main screen. 

A file called highscores.csv will be created if none exists and high scores read and updated every run.
